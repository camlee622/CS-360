Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements for the application I developed were: 
- Have an inventory tracking application that lets the user update and save the quantity of particular items in the list
- Give the user the ability to add, delete, and update items
- Give the user the ability to register for SMS alerts based on low stock notifications
- Have a login screen where the user can register or login to an existing account

This ties in with the user needs for this application which was to have a way to keep an inventory items.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My UI designs kept the user in mind by retaining good navigability and simplicity. I think this made my design successful, because it was an easy application to traverse through all of the features and few the inventory in an orderly fashion. As far as screens and features, I did have a screen for logins which contained a database with the usernames/passwords for the userbase. From there was a screen for an inventory list that could have items added and viewed. If the user wanted to add an item, the button could be pressed and they could enter the appropriate information. If the user wanted to view previously added items, the user could select any item in the list and view/adjust the item.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I approached this application development process by starting with the login screen and creating the UI, and going from there with the rest of the UI. Once all of the UI was created, I started on coding it, in the same order and fashion. From there, I had to make small changes to the UI, but I would rather make changes on the UI than with the code by reversing the process. The main strategy I used was to run the application frequently to ensure that it continued to work. I think this can always be applied in the future because typing up a huge portion of code and running is not an efficient way to test.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I knew that when I ran the code, I had an expected result for the run test. This helped me determine it's functionality. This process is incredibly important because it helped me make sure that I was reaching the requirements for the project and meeting the client's and user's needs. When doing this, it revealed issues that I had run into and gave guidance on how to get myself back on the correct path towards the final product.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my head, I had a different vision for the inventory list showing quantities and item names, so my initial design for UI and my final product are quite different. I had to adjust my code to allow the user to click individual items to then view the quantity versus having them on the same inventory screen.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the component that I was most proud of in this project was the login activity screen. This process remained the most consistent between my initial vision for the product and the final version. It performed exactly how I imagined and I think the design is something that I was really proud of creating.
